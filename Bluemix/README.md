## Included Components
This repository contains the following Kubernetes deployment descriptors to deploy an IBMÂ® Operational Decision Manager (ODM) Standard  topology in your Bluemix cluster:
- [ODM Standard deployment descriptor for a Bluemix lite cluster](./odm-standard-bx-lite.yaml)
- [ODM Standard deployment descriptor for a Bluemix standard cluster](./odm-standard-bx-standard.yaml)

## Testing
This material was tested with the following configuration:
- MacOS 10.12.4,
- Kubernetes
   - client 1.6.2
   - server 1.5.6
- Docker 17.03
- ODM 8.9.0

## Troubleshooting
* If your ODM services cannot be reached right after the deployment is created, wait for a few minutes so that the connectivity is completed in the hosted cluster.
* If your microservice instance is not running properly, check the logs by using the following command:
	* `kubectl logs <your-pod-name>`
* To delete a microservice, use the following command:
	* `kubectl delete -f manifests/<microservice-yaml-file>`
* To delete everything, use the following command:
	* `kubectl delete -f manifests`
